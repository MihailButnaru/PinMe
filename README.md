## PINME

I have created Pin Me because I love to code, the version is just a demo and if you download it you will see that is working just the car version. I am still working on it and trying to add more feature to it and trying to finish the plane version. The plane version will be a little bit different, but will look very well too.

The application takes Google Api and aswell it calculates the price of the fuel using today's price. You can check it manually if not just email me and I will explain how is working.

I have fixed few bugs but I am still working on the API


THIS IS A DEMO VERSION. ENJOY!
